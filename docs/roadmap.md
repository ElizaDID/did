# ElizaDID Roadmap

ElizaDID aims to build a privacy-preserving platform combining Decentralized Identity (DID), AI Agents, and Solana. Below is our detailed roadmap:

## Phase 1: Foundation (March - April 2025)
- **Goal**: Establish a working prototype.
- **Tasks**:
  - Clone ElizaOS and configure Solana Devnet.
  - Implement basic DID generation and verification.
  - Enable Agent to perform a simple Solana transaction (e.g., transfer 1 SOL).
- **Milestone**: Complete a DID-authorized transaction on Devnet.

## Phase 2: Privacy & Expansion (May - July 2025)
- **Goal**: Integrate privacy features and expand Agent capabilities.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add off-chain encrypted storage (e.g., IPFS).
  - Implement a basic ZKP circuit (e.g., "balance > 10 SOL").
  - Enable Agent to execute DeFi tasks (e.g., token swap).
- **Milestone**: Perform a privacy-preserving DeFi operation.

## Phase 3: Optimization & Testing (August - September 2025)
- **Goal**: Prepare for public testing.
- **Tasks**:
  - Optimize transaction throughput and reduce latency.
  - Conduct security audits on DID and ZKP logic.
  - Build a CLI for user interaction.
- **Milestone**: Stable Testnet deployment with 10 successful tasks.

## Phase 4: Mainnet Launch (October - December 2025)
- **Goal**: Go live and integrate with Solana ecosystem.
- **Tasks**:
  - Deploy to Solana Mainnet.
  - Connect with ecosystem projects (e.g., NFT markets, DAOs).
  - Release SDK and documentation for developers.
- **Milestone**: First real user transaction on Mainnet.
